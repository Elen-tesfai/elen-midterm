## Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **classification modeling techniques** to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. The goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on input features, utilizing machine learning techniques to classify the data effectively.

## Dataset

For this project, I used the **[Heart Disease Prediction Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)**, which predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on medical features. The dataset includes numerical features like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol, with a binary target variable indicating whether the patient has heart disease.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following files:

- **[classification_heart_disease_midterm.ipynb](./classification_heart_disease_midterm.ipynb)**: The Jupyter notebook that contains the entire analysis process, including data inspection, exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: This file, summarizing the project and the dataset.
- **peer_review.md**: A peer review file of a classmate's project (after reviewing).
- **data/**: A folder that contains the dataset used for the analysis.

## Steps Followed in the Notebook

### Section 1: Import and Inspect the Data
#### 1.1 Load the dataset and display the first 10 rows
The first step is to load the dataset into the notebook and inspect its initial rows to understand its structure.

#### 1.2 Check for missing values and display summary statistics
We check for any missing values in the dataset and display basic statistical information like mean, median, and standard deviation for each feature.

**Reflection 1:**  
What do you notice about the dataset? Are there any data issues?

---

### Section 2: Data Exploration and Preparation
#### 2.1 Explore data patterns and distributions
We explore data patterns by creating histograms, boxplots, and count plots for the categorical variables. Additionally, we identify any anomalies and outliers in feature distributions. We also check for class imbalance in the target variable (if applicable).

#### 2.2 Handle missing values and clean data
We handle missing data either by imputing or dropping missing values as necessary. We also address outliers and transform data if needed, such as encoding categorical variables into numerical ones.

#### 2.3 Feature selection and engineering
We create new features or combine existing ones to improve the model's performance. We may also scale or normalize data to make sure it's ready for modeling.

**Reflection 2:**  
What patterns or anomalies do you see? Do any features stand out? What preprocessing steps were necessary to clean and improve the data? Did you create or modify any features to improve performance?

---

### Section 3: Feature Selection and Justification
#### 3.1 Choose features and target
We select the relevant input features for classification and define the target variable. The input features can be numerical or categorical, while the target is typically categorical (e.g., heart disease or no heart disease).

#### 3.2 Define X and y
The feature matrix (X) is defined by selecting the relevant input features, and the target vector (y) is defined by the target variable.

**Reflection 3:**  
Why did you choose these features? How might they impact predictions or accuracy?

---

### Section 4: Train a Model (Classification)
#### 4.1 Split the data into training and test sets
We use a technique like `train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets. In the case of class imbalance, we may use a more specialized split method like `StratifiedShuffleSplit`.

#### 4.2 Train the model using Scikit-Learn
We train the classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) using the `model.fit()` method from Scikit-Learn.

#### 4.3 Evaluate performance
We evaluate the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.

**Reflection 4:**  
How well did the model perform? Any surprises in the results?

---

### Section 5: Improve the Model or Try Alternatives
#### 5.1 Train an alternative classifier
We may try an alternative classification model (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to see if it performs better.

#### 5.2 Compare performance of all models
We compare the performance of all models based on the same metrics used for evaluation (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

**Reflection 5:**  
Which model performed better? Why might one classifier be more effective in this specific case?

---

### Section 6: Final Thoughts & Insights
#### 6.1 Summarize findings
We summarize the main findings of the analysis, including which model worked best and any patterns discovered in the data.

#### 6.2 Discuss challenges faced
We discuss any challenges or obstacles encountered while working through the project, such as data issues, model tuning, etc.

#### 6.3 If you had more time, what would you try next?
If given more time, what would be the next steps for improving the model or further analyzing the data?

**Reflection 6:**  
What did you learn from this project?

## Peer Review

In addition to completing the project, I also reviewed a classmate's project and provided feedback on:

- **Clarity & Organization**: Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?
- **Feature Selection & Justification**: Do the chosen features make sense?
- **Model Performance & Comparisons**: Are the results and comparisons explained clearly?
- **Reflection Quality**: Are insights well thought out?

2. **Uploaded the dataset**: Stored in the `data` folder.
3. **Developed a Jupyter Notebook**: `classification_heart_disease_midterm.ipynb`, with reflections after each section.
4. **Completed Peer Review**: Submitted feedback in `peer_review.md`.
