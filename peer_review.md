## 1. Clarity & Organization
The notebook is well-structured, with clear section labels that make it easy to follow. The flow of the content is logical, and each step is explained clearly. You've also included summaries at the end of each section, which is a great touch to highlight the key takeaways.

**Suggestion**: The summaries are great; perhaps consider slightly expanding them to make sure that every critical detail is emphasized, especially for sections with more complex explanations.

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification
The choice of "odor" and "gill size" as key features is both interesting and effective in achieving high accuracy. However, providing a bit more context on why these particular features were chosen would strengthen your rationale.

**Suggestion**: It would be helpful to briefly explain why these two features were selected over others and how they specifically contribute to the model's performance.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
The explanation of model performance is clear. However, adding additional metrics such as precision and recall would provide a more complete picture of the model's behavior, especially given the potential for class imbalance in this dataset.

**Suggestion**: Including more performance metrics, like precision, recall, and F1-score, would help evaluate the model more comprehensively, especially for classification tasks where class imbalance might be an issue.

## 4. Reflection Quality
Your reflections are insightful, particularly regarding how the selected features influenced model performance. However, the reflection could benefit from more exploration of how handling missing data (e.g., filling missing values with "unknown") may have impacted the results.

**Suggestion**: Consider adding a few thoughts on how the approach to handling missing data (using the "unknown" category) might have influenced the model's outcomes and accuracy.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, your notebook is well-structured, and the insights on feature selection are informative. To further improve, I suggest adding more detailed justifications for your feature choices and expanding your model evaluation with additional metrics.
